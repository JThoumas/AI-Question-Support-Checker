      "question": "How do I get better at solving algorithm problems? I freeze when the question looks long.",
      "summary": "Quick AI Summary:\n\nTo improve at solving algorithm problems, start by breaking down complex questions into smaller, manageable parts. Practice regularly with easier problems first to build confidence and pattern recognition. Focus on understanding the underlying concepts rather than memorizing solutions. Use resources like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars to practice consistently. When you encounter a long problem, read it carefully, identify the key requirements, and sketch out your approach before coding. Remember, persistence and consistent practice are key to overcoming the initial freeze response.",
